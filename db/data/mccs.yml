    In Version 2.2 forward, except Version 3.0, VCP 0x0C defines the

    A value of 0 must be treated as a request for a color temperature of
    3000° K. Values greater than 0 must be used as a multiplier of the
    color temperature increment (read using VCP 0x0B) and the result
    added to the base value of 3000°K
  desc_long: >-
    VCP codes 0x0B and 0x0C define the User Color Temperature when selected using VCP 0x14.

    If the display is unable to achieve the requested color temperature,
    then it must move to the closest possible temperature.

    Example:
    If VCP 0x0B returns a value of 50° K and VCP code 0x0C sends a
    value of 50 (decimal) then the display must interpret this as a
    request to adjust the color temperature to 5500° K
    (3000 + (50 * 50)) K = 5500° K

    NOTE:
    Applications using this function are recommended to read the actual
    color temperature after using this command and taking appropriate
    action.

    This control is only recommended if the display can produce a
    continuously (at defined increment, see VCP code 0x0B) variable
    color temperature.

    A possible value is selected by setting the

      The following description of this VCP in versions prior to V2.2 is

      The SH byte defines whether operation should be performed as a
      white adjustment or as a red / green or blue backlight adjustment
      when these are separate light sources (e.g. LEDs)

      When read, the MH-Ml bytes contain the flags corresponding to
      those functions supported by the display. The SH-SL bytes contain
      the bit field with the appropriate bit set to indicate the current status
      of the display.

      The following table defines the SH byte, and the MH byte for read
      operations only.

      0x00 = A white adjustment

      0x01 = A red adjustment

      0x02 = A green adjustment

      0x03 = A blue adjustment

      ≥ 0x04 = Reserved, must be ignored

      NOTE: The adjustment range (0 → 255) will be mapped to the
      actual adjustment range defined by the display manufacturer. A
      value of 0 corresponds to the lowest value and 255 the highest
      value.

    NOTE: In all cases a read operation must return the nominal color

    Setting 0x14 to User 1, 2, or 3, recalls values for and enables VCP
    codes 0x0B and 0x0C. In addition all VCP registers must reflect the
    register change required to match the color change. Consider 0x16,

    A tolerance specified as 5% and preset 0x09 is selected then color
    temperature is specified as 10000° K ± 5%.
